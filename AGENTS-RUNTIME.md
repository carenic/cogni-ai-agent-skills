Note: **Path Resolution**: For GitHub runtime within runner when triggered by `cogni-ai-agent-action`, these
instructions may be loaded from a temporary directory (e.g., `${{ runner.temp }}/.skills/`). When reading a skill
file below, you MUST resolve its relative path against the directory where this `AGENTS-RUNTIME.md` file is located
(check the "Instructions from: `<path>`" header in your system prompt), NOT your current working directory.

### Structural Invariant

- **Skills Location**: Skills are located directly in the root directory of this repository.
