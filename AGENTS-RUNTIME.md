# AGENTS-RUNTIME.md

Persistent single-source truth for autonomous agent behavior.

## Skills

You MUST load the skills relevant to the user prompt, inferred intent,
and planned work into the current context.

**Tool Execution Invariants:**

- **Idempotent Skill Loading**:
  Avoid redundant `skill` tool calls for the same skill in the same conversation turn or session.
  Once a skill is loaded, its instructions are active for the duration of the agent's operation in that context.
- **Native Tool Calling ONLY**:
  When executing tools (including the `skill` tool, `bash`, or others),
  you MUST use the native tool calling mechanism provided by your environment.
  NEVER emit literal text strings like `[tool_call: ...]` or write out your intended tool calls as plain text in your response.
- **Parallel Tool Calls**:
  If you need to load multiple skills or call multiple tools, invoke the native tool call for each tool independently
  in the same turn. Do not write pseudo-code or text blocks mimicking tool calls.

Note: **Path Resolution**: For GitHub runtime within runner when triggered by `cogni-ai-agent-action`, these
instructions may be loaded from a temporary directory (e.g., `${{ runner.temp }}/.skills/`). When reading a skill
file below, you MUST resolve its relative path against the directory where this `AGENTS-RUNTIME.md` file is located
(check the "Instructions from: `<path>`" header in your system prompt), NOT your current working directory.

### Structural Invariant

- **Skills Location**: Skills are located directly in the root directory of this repository.
