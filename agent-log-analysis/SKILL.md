# Agent Log Analysis & Reporting

This skill dictates the mechanical execution and rigid formatting requirements for auditing AI agent session logs.

## 1. Log Retrieval Mechanics

If logs are not directly provided in the prompt, retrieve them using:

- **GitHub Actions Runs**: `gh run view <run-id> --log` or `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
- **Local Artifacts**: Parse directories under `temp/extract/` or `logs/` using `grep`, `cat`, or file search tools.

Raw logs from GitHub runs can be filtered by:

```bash
awk '/PROMPT:/,/Post job cleanup/ { $1=""; print substr($0,2) }'
```

## 2. Standardized Reporting Structure

You MUST systematically output your findings adhering to this strict standardized structure.
Do not invent new structures or deviate from these templates.

### 2.1 Text Report (Markdown)

```markdown
#### Brief

The agent session for **github.run_id [Run ID] (attempt [Attempt Number])** was
[successful / unsuccessful / partially successful] and [followed / deviated from]
established protocols. Operating as the `[Agent Persona]`, the agent completed
the task of [Brief Task Description] while maintaining strict adherence to the
project's initialization and verification workflows.

#### Prompt Summary

* **Trigger Source:** [e.g., GitHub issue comment, manual workflow run]
* **Prompt Summary:** [Brief summary of the input prompt/trigger.]

#### Session Summary

* **Primary Task:** [What was the agent explicitly instructed to do?]
* **Workflow Compliance:** [Did the agent load the necessary constraints, flows, and instructions?]
* **Conclusion:** [What was the final state?]

#### Key Actions & Decisions

* **Context Gathering:** [How did the agent acquire necessary information?]
* **Agent Interactions:** [List any sub-agents called and their purpose (e.g., Architect -> Brain Ops).]
* **Task/Workflow Management:** [How did it track progress?]
* **Execution / Tracing:** [What were the core actions taken?]
* **Self-Verification:** [Did it verify the environment state?]

#### Session Telemetry

* **Execution Time:** [Total time taken]
* **Steps Taken:** [Number of steps]
* **Tool Calls:** [Total number of tool calls]
* **Tokens Used:** [Optional: total tokens if available]

#### Root Cause Identified (If Applicable)

The agent discovered a **[brief description of the core issue]**:
1. **[Step 1]**: [Description]

#### Issues Encountered

* **[Issue / None]:** [Describe any tool failures or explicitly state "None".]

#### Recommendation Provided (Optional)
[Summarize any recommendations]
```

Note: Don't include code block for above.

### 2.2 Comprehensive Visual Audit Suite (Mermaid & Data)

#### A. Agent Radar Analysis

Generate a `radar-beta` diagram to score the agent from 1 to 10 on core competencies:

```mermaid
radar-beta
    title Agent Performance Alignment
    axis Task_Completion, Protocol_Compliance, Tool_Proficiency, Self_Verification, Analytical_Depth, Execution_Efficiency
    curve Agent {8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7}
```

#### B. Agent Execution Flow (Sequence Diagram)

Generate a Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` visualizing chronological actions.

- **Participants**: `Workflow`, `Agent`, `[Sub-Agent]`, `Tools`, `FileSystem`, `GitHub`
- **Focus**: Initialization, Context Gathering, Agent Interactions (e.g., Task/delegation calls), Execution, Verification.

Example showing sub-agent interaction:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as Workflow
    participant A as Architect
    participant B as BrainOps
    participant T as Tools

    W->>A: Start Task
    A->>T: Search Context
    T-->>A: Results
    A->>B: Delegate Architecture Plan
    B-->>A: Proposed Plan
    A->>T: Implement Plan
```

#### C. Agent Execution Journey (Friction & Success Map)

Generate a Mermaid `journey` diagram of problem-solving friction.

- **Score 1-5**: (5: Flawless, 1: Error/Hard failure).
- **Sections**: `Initialization`, `Investigation`, `Execution`, `Verification`.
- **Actors**: `Agent`, `Bash`, `GitHubAPI`, `FileSystem`.

#### D. Agent Execution Alignment (Venn Diagram)

Generate a Mermaid `venn-beta` diagram visualizing action alignment. Ensure strings are properly delimited.

```mermaid
venn-beta
    title "Action Alignment"
    set Intent["Request"]
    set Actions["Actions"]
    set Rules["Protocols"]

    union Intent,Actions["Targeted"]
    union Intent,Rules["Expected"]
    union Actions,Rules["Compliant"]
    union Intent,Actions,Rules["Execution"]
```

#### E. Root Cause & System Architecture (If Errors Occurred)

If failures or bugs hit the agent, you MUST generate:

1. **`ishikawa-beta`**: Evaluate branches to find the root cause of the failure.

   ```mermaid
   ishikawa-beta
       Agent Failure Description
       Context & Prompts
           Missing instructions
       Tools & Capabilities
           Bash restricted
       Logic & Reasoning
           Hallucinated path
       Workflow & Protocols
           Skipped verification
       Environment
           Read-only repo
   ```

2. **`architecture-beta`**: Visualize mechanical boundaries to show where data dropped or the chain failed.

   ```mermaid
   architecture-beta
       group api(cloud)[API Gateway]
       service auth(server)[Auth Service] in api
       service db(database)[Session DB] in api

        service user(user)[Agent Session]
        user:R -- L:auth
        auth:R -- L:db
    ```

#### F. Agent Tool Usage Mindmap

Generate a Mermaid `mindmap` visualizing the hierarchy of tools
and their key parameters or sub-commands executed during the session.

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Tools))
    Glob
      pattern
    Read
      filePath
    Shell
      command
        gh
        grep
    Skill
      gh-run
      git
    Task
      subagent_type
        brain-ops
    Todo
```

#### G. Agent File Access Hierarchy

Generate a Mermaid `treeView-beta` diagram visualizing the hierarchy of files and directories accessed by the agent.

**Accessed Files Tree**

```mermaid
treeView-beta
    "AGENTS.md"
    ".github"
        "workflows"
            "check.yml"
```

#### H. Agent Task Board (Kanban)

Generate a Mermaid `kanban` diagram to visualize the task board and tracking state.
Column headers SHOULD include status metadata. To avoid breaking Mermaid syntax, DO NOT use structural characters like
`{}`, `[]`, `()`, `<`, or `>` in labels.

```mermaid
kanban
  Todo - Status: completed
    [Create Documentation]
    docs[Create Blog about the new diagram]
  In Progress - Status: in_progress
    id6[Create renderer for all cases]
  Ready for Deploy - Status: pending
    id8[Design grammar]@{ assigned: 'agent' }
```

#### I. Agent Tool Utilization (Pie Chart)

Generate a Mermaid `pie` diagram to visualize the relative frequency of tool calls.

```mermaid
pie title "Tool Call Distribution"
    "Glob" : 1
    "Read" : 2
    "Shell" : 3
    "Skill" : 4
    "Task" : 5
    "Todo" : 1
```

#### J. Agent Cognitive & Execution Loop (State Diagram)

Generate a Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` modeling the internal state machine.

- **States**: `Initializing`, `ContextGathering`, `Executing`, `ErrorRecovery`, `Verifying`.
- **Transitions**: Explain *why* the agent moved states (e.g., "Syntax Error Detected").
