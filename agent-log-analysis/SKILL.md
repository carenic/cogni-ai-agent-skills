# Agent Log Analysis & Reporting

This skill dictates the mechanical execution and rigid formatting requirements for auditing AI agent session logs.

## 1. Log Retrieval Mechanics

If logs are not directly provided in the prompt, retrieve them using:

- **GitHub Actions Runs**: `gh run view <run-id> --log` or `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
- **Local Artifacts**: Parse directories under `temp/extract/` or `logs/` using `grep`, `cat`, or file search tools.

Raw logs from GitHub runs can be filtered by:

```bash
awk '/PROMPT:/,/Post job cleanup/ { $1=""; print substr($0,2) }'
```

## 2. Artifact Extraction

When analyzing logs, specifically identify any external artifacts created or modified:
- **Pull Requests**: Look for "Created PR #<number>", "Creating pull request...", or "gh pr create" success messages.
- **Issues**: Look for "Created issue #<number>", "gh issue create" success messages, or comments.
- **Commits/Branches**: Look for "git push", "Pushed to <branch>", or commit SHA references.

## 3. Skill Loading Analysis

When analyzing logs, verify the skill loading process:
- **Skill Discovery**: Identify which skills the agent attempted to load (e.g., `skill` tool calls).
- **Loading Success**: Confirm if the skills were successfully loaded into the context.
- **Missing Skills**: Identify if the agent failed to load a skill that was clearly relevant to the task.

## 4. Standardized Reporting Structure

You MUST systematically output your findings adhering to this strict standardized structure.
Do not invent new structures or deviate from these templates.

### 4.1 Text Report (Markdown)

```markdown
#### Brief

The agent session for **github.run_id [Run ID] (attempt [Attempt Number])** was [successful / unsuccessful / partially successful]
and [followed / deviated from] established protocols.
Operating as the `[Agent Persona]`, the agent completed the task of [Brief Task Description]
while maintaining strict adherence to the project's initialization and verification workflows.

#### Prompt Summary

Note: The Text Report must be output as direct Markdown; do not wrap the resulting report in an outer code block.

### 4.2 Comprehensive Visual Audit Suite (Mermaid & Data)

#### A. Agent Tool Utilization (Pie Chart)

Generate the following Mermaid `pie` diagrams to visualize the relative frequency of tool and command calls.

**Tool Utilization Pie Chart**

```mermaid
pie title Tool Call Distribution
    "Glob" : 1
    "Read" : 2
    "Shell" : 3
    "Skill" : 4
    "Task" : 5
    "Todo" : 1
    "Webfetch": 1
    "Write": 1
```

Note: Include only high-level tool names without actual commands.

**Command Utilization Pie Chart**

```mermaid
pie title Command Call Distribution
    "git" : 1
    "gh" : 2
    "ls" : 3
```

Note: Include only actual bash tool commands.

#### B. Agent Tool Usage Mindmap

Generate a Mermaid `mindmap` visualizing the hierarchy of tools
and their key parameters or sub-commands executed during the session.

**Tool Usage Mindmap**

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Tools))
    Glob
      pattern
    Read
      filePath
    Shell
      command
        gh
        grep
    Skill
      gh-run
      git
    Task
      subagent_type
        brain-ops
    Todo
    Webfetch
      url
```

#### C. Agent Execution Flow (Sequence Diagram)

Generate a Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` visualizing chronological actions.

- **Participants**: `Workflow`, `Agent`, `[Sub-Agent]`, `Tools`, `FileSystem`, `GitHub`
- **Focus**: Initialization, Skill Loading, Context Gathering, Agent Interactions
  (e.g., Task/delegation calls), Execution, Verification.

Example showing sub-agent interaction:

**Agent Execution Flow**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent
    participant B as Bash Shell
    participant D as DevOps
    participant R as Runtime
    participant S as Skills
    participant T as Tools
    participant W as Webfetch

    R->>A: Start Session (Trigger)
    A->>T: Load relevant Skills
    T->>S: Read SKILL.md files
    S-->>A: Context Injected
    A->>T: Context Gathering
    T->>W: Fetch external docs
    W-->>A: Markdown results
    A->>D: Delegate sub-task (Task tool)
    D-->>A: Sub-agent results
    A->>T: Execute implementation
    T->>B: Run git/gh commands
    B-->>A: CLI response
```

#### D. Agent Execution Journey (Friction & Success Map)

Generate a Mermaid `journey` diagram of problem-solving friction.

- **Score 1-5**: (5: Flawless, 1: Error/Hard failure).
- **Sections**: `Initialization`, `Investigation`, `Execution`, `Verification`.
- **Actors**: `Agent`, `Bash`, `GitHubAPI`, `FileSystem`.

#### E. Agent Execution Alignment (Venn Diagram)

Generate a Mermaid `venn-beta` diagram visualizing action alignment. Ensure strings are properly delimited.

```mermaid
venn-beta
    title Action Alignment
    set Intent["Request"]
    set Actions["Actions"]
    set Rules["Protocols"]

    union Intent,Actions["Targeted"]
    union Intent,Rules["Expected"]
    union Actions,Rules["Compliant"]
    union Intent,Actions,Rules["Execution"]
```

#### F. Root Cause & System Architecture (If Errors Occurred)

If failures or bugs hit the agent, you MUST generate:

1. **`ishikawa-beta`**: Evaluate branches to find the root cause of the failure.

   ```mermaid
   ishikawa-beta
       Agent Failure Description
       Context & Prompts
           Missing instructions
       Tools & Capabilities
           Bash restricted
       Logic & Reasoning
           Hallucinated path
       Workflow & Protocols
           Skipped verification
       Environment
           Read-only repo
   ```

2. **`architecture-beta`**: Visualize mechanical boundaries to show where data dropped or the chain failed.

   ```mermaid
   architecture-beta
       group api(cloud)[API Gateway]
       service auth(server)[Auth Service] in api
       service db(database)[Session DB] in api

        service user(user)[Agent Session]
        user:R -- L:auth
        auth:R -- L:db
    ```

#### G. Agent File Access Hierarchy

Generate a Mermaid `treeView-beta` diagram visualizing the hierarchy of files and directories accessed by the agent.

**Accessed Files Tree**

```mermaid
treeView-beta
    "AGENTS.md"
    ".github"
        "workflows"
            "check.yml"
```

#### H. Agent Task Board (Kanban)

Generate a Mermaid `kanban` diagram to visualize the task board and tracking state.
Column headers SHOULD include status metadata.
**IMPORTANT**: Do not use special characters such as brackets `()` within task labels; they must be escaped or removed as they will break Mermaid syntax.
This MUST be based on the actual `todos` found in the agent session logs
(e.g., from `todowrite` tool calls or explicit task tracking), not invented tasks.
To avoid breaking Mermaid syntax, DO NOT use structural characters like
`{}`, `[]`, `()`, `<`, or `>` in labels.

**Agent Task Board**

```mermaid
---
config:
  kanban:
    ticketBaseUrl: 'https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/#TICKET#'
---
kanban
  Todo - Status: pending
    [Create Documentation]
    docs[Create file with the new diagram]
    id4[Create parsing tests]@{ ticket: 2038, assigned: 'agent', priority: 'High' }
  In Progress - Status: in progress
    id6[Create renderer for all cases]@{ ticket: 2039, priority: 'Medium' }
  Completed - Status: completed
    id8[Design grammar]@{ assigned: 'agent' }
    id9[Verify environment]@{ ticket: 2040, assigned: 'agent' }
```

#### I. Agent Cognitive & Execution Loop (State Diagram)

Generate a Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` modeling the internal state machine.

- **States**: `Initializing`, `ContextGathering`, `Executing`, `ErrorRecovery`, `Verifying`.
- **Transitions**: Explain *why* the agent moved states (e.g., "Syntax Error Detected").

#### J. Agent Performance Quadrant

Generate a `quadrantChart` to visualize agent performance across tasks:

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Agent Task Analysis
    x-axis Low Efficiency --> High Efficiency
    y-axis Low Accuracy --> High Accuracy
    quadrant-1 Elite
    quadrant-2 Methodical
    quadrant-3 Struggling
    quadrant-4 Careless
    "Refactor": [0.3, 0.8]
    "Bug Fix": [0.6, 0.9]
    "Doc Update": [0.9, 0.7]
    "Feature": [0.2, 0.4]
    "Test": [0.8, 0.2]
```

#### K. Agent Radar Analysis

Generate a `radar-beta` diagram to score the agent from 1 to 10 on core competencies:

```mermaid
radar-beta
    title Agent Performance Alignment
    axis Completion, Compliance, Proficiency, Verification, Depth, Efficiency
    curve Agent {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
```
