# Agent Log Analysis & Reporting

This skill dictates the mechanical execution and rigid formatting requirements for auditing AI agent session logs.

## When to Use

- Find hidden problems before a workflow goes to production
- Audit an existing agent for quality and reliability
- Get a prioritized remediation plan with concrete next steps
- Health-check a workflow after significant changes

## 1. Log Retrieval Mechanics

If logs are not directly provided in the prompt, retrieve them using:

- **GitHub Actions Runs**: `gh run view <run-id> --log` or `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
- **Local Artifacts**: Parse directories under `temp/extract/` or `logs/` using `grep`, `cat`, or file search tools.

Raw logs from GitHub runs can be filtered by:

```bash
awk '/PROMPT:/,/Post job cleanup/ { $1=""; print substr($0,2) }'
```

## 2. Artifact Extraction

When analyzing logs, specifically identify any external artifacts created or modified:

- **Pull Requests**: Look for "Created PR #`<number>`", "Creating pull request...", or "gh pr create" success messages.
- **Issues**: Look for "Created issue #`<number>`", "gh issue create" success messages, or comments.
- **Commits/Branches**: Look for "git push", "Pushed to `<branch>`", or commit SHA references.

## 3. Skill Loading Analysis

When analyzing logs, verify the skill loading process:

- **Skill Discovery**: Identify which skills the agent attempted to load (e.g., `skill` tool calls).
- **Loading Success**: Confirm if the skills were successfully loaded into the context.
- **Missing Skills**: Identify if the agent failed to load a skill that was clearly relevant to the task.

## 4. Standardized Reporting Structure

You MUST systematically output your findings adhering to this strict standardized structure.
Do not invent new structures or deviate from these templates.

### 4.1 Text Report (Markdown)

```markdown
#### Brief

The agent session for **github.run_id [Run ID] (attempt [Attempt Number])** was [successful / unsuccessful / partially successful]
and [followed / deviated from] established protocols.
Operating as the `[Agent Persona]`, the agent completed the task of [Brief Task Description]
while maintaining strict adherence to the project's initialization and verification workflows.

Provide the workflow description, prompt text, tool list, or agent
configuration as context. The more detail you provide, the more precise the findings.

* **Tokens Used:**
  [Optional: total tokens if available]

#### Issues/Limitations Encountered

* **[Issue / None]:**
  [Describe any tool failures or explicitly state "None"]
  [Include any syntax errors, command hangs or other unexpected activity]

* **[Limitation / None]:**
  [Describe any failures due to access or environment limitations]

Note: The Text Report must be output as direct Markdown; do not wrap the resulting report in an outer code block.

### 4.2 Comprehensive Visual Audit Suite (Mermaid & Data)

#### A. Agent Tool Utilization (Pie Chart)

Generate the following Mermaid `pie` diagrams to visualize the relative frequency of tool and command calls.

##### Tool Utilization Pie Chart

```mermaid
pie title Tool Call Distribution
    "Glob" : 1
    "Grep": 2
    "Read" : 3
    "Search": 4
    "Shell" : 5
    "Skill" : 6
    "Task" : 7
    "Todo" : 8
    "Webfetch": 1
    "Write": 1
```

Note: Include only high-level tool names without actual commands.

##### Command Utilization Pie Chart

```mermaid
pie title Command Call Distribution
    "git" : 1
    "gh" : 2
    "ls" : 3
```

Note: Include only actual bash tool commands.

#### B. Agent Tool Usage Mindmap

Generate a Mermaid `mindmap` visualizing the hierarchy of tools
and their key parameters or sub-commands executed during the session.

##### Tool Usage Mindmap

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Tools))
    Glob
      pattern
    Grep
      pattern
    Read
      filePath
    Search
      query

      git
    Task
      subagent_type
        brain-ops
    Todo
    Webfetch
      url
```

#### C. Agent Execution Flow (Sequence Diagram)

Generate a Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` visualizing chronological actions.

- **Participants**: `Workflow`, `Agent`, `[Sub-Agent]`, `Tools`, `FileSystem`, `GitHub`
- **Focus**: Initialization, Skill Loading, Context Gathering, Agent Interactions
  (e.g., Task/delegation calls), Execution, Verification.

Example showing sub-agent interaction:

##### Agent Execution Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent
    participant B as Bash Shell
    participant D as DevOps
    participant R as Runtime
    participant S as Skills
    participant T as Tools
    participant W as Webfetch

    R->>A: Start Session (Trigger)
    A->>T: Load relevant Skills
    T->>S: Read SKILL.md files
    S-->>A: Context Injected
    A->>T: Context Gathering
    T->>W: Fetch external docs
    W-->>A: Markdown results
    A->>D: Delegate sub-task (Task tool)
    D-->>A: Sub-agent results
    A->>T: Execute implementation
    T->>B: Run git/gh commands
    B-->>A: CLI response
```

#### D. Agent Execution Journey (Friction & Success Map)

Generate a Mermaid `journey` diagram of problem-solving friction.

- **Score 1-5**: (5: Flawless, 1: Error/Hard failure).
- **Sections**: `Initialization`, `Investigation`, `Execution`, `Verification`.
- **Actors**: `Agent`, `Bash`, `GitHubAPI`, `FileSystem`.

#### E. Agent Execution Alignment (Venn Diagram)

Generate a Mermaid `venn-beta` diagram visualizing action alignment. Ensure strings are properly delimited.

```mermaid
venn-beta
    title Action Alignment
    set Intent["Request"]
    set Actions["Actions"]
    set Rules["Protocols"]

    union Intent,Actions["Targeted"]
    union Intent,Rules["Expected"]
    union Actions,Rules["Compliant"]
    union Intent,Actions,Rules["Execution"]
```

#### F. Root Cause & System Architecture (If Errors Occurred)

If failures or bugs hit the agent, you MUST generate:

1. **`ishikawa-beta`**: Evaluate branches to find the root cause of the failure.

   ```mermaid
   ishikawa-beta
       Agent Failure Description
       Context & Prompts
           Missing instructions
       Tools & Capabilities
           Bash restricted
       Logic & Reasoning
           Hallucinated path
       Workflow & Protocols
           Skipped verification
       Environment
           Read-only repo
   ```

2. **`architecture-beta`**: Visualize mechanical boundaries to show where data dropped or the chain failed.

   ```mermaid
   architecture-beta
       group api(cloud)[API Gateway]
       service auth(server)[Auth Service] in api
       service db(database)[Session DB] in api

        service user(user)[Agent Session]
        user:R -- L:auth
        auth:R -- L:db
    ```

#### G. Agent File Access Hierarchy

Generate a Mermaid `treeView-beta` diagram visualizing the hierarchy of files and directories accessed by the agent.

##### Accessed Files Tree

```mermaid
treeView-beta
    "AGENTS.md"
    ".github"
        "workflows"
            "check.yml"
```

#### H. Agent Task Board (Kanban)

Generate a Mermaid `kanban` diagram to visualize the task board and tracking state.
Column headers SHOULD include status metadata.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not include structural characters such as `()`, `{}`, `[]`, `<`, or `>`
inside task text. This rule applies only to actual todos extracted from agent session
logs (e.g., from `todowrite`/`todos`). Keep Mermaid-required card wrappers (outer `[...]`)
and escape/remove these characters from the label content itself.

##### Agent Task Board

```mermaid
---
config:
  kanban:
    ticketBaseUrl: 'https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/#TICKET#'
---
kanban
  Todo - Status: pending
    [Create Documentation]
    docs[Create file with the new diagram]
    id4[Create parsing tests]@{ ticket: 2038, assigned: 'agent', priority: 'High' }
  In Progress - Status: in progress
    id6[Create renderer for all cases]@{ ticket: 2039, priority: 'Medium' }
  Completed - Status: completed
    id8[Design grammar]@{ assigned: 'agent' }
    id9[Verify environment]@{ ticket: 2040, assigned: 'agent' }
```

#### I. Agent Cognitive & Execution Loop (State Diagram)

Generate a Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` modeling the internal state machine.

- **States**: `Initializing`, `ContextGathering`, `Executing`, `ErrorRecovery`, `Verifying`.
- **Transitions**: Explain *why* the agent moved states (e.g., "Syntax Error Detected").

#### J. Agent Performance Quadrant

Generate a `quadrantChart` to visualize agent performance across tasks:

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Agent Task Analysis
    x-axis Low Efficiency --> High Efficiency
    y-axis Low Accuracy --> High Accuracy
    quadrant-1 Elite
    quadrant-2 Methodical
    quadrant-3 Struggling
    quadrant-4 Careless
    "Refactor": [0.3, 0.8]
    "Bug Fix": [0.6, 0.9]
    "Doc Update": [0.9, 0.7]
    "Feature": [0.2, 0.4]
    "Test": [0.8, 0.2]
```

#### K. Agent Radar Analysis

Generate a `radar-beta` diagram to score the agent from 1 to 10 on core competencies:

```mermaid
radar-beta
    title Agent Performance Alignment
    axis Completion, Compliance, Proficiency, Verification, Depth, Efficiency
    curve Agent {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
```

Generate second `radar-beta` diagram to score the agent from 1 to 5 across 5 quality dimensions:

**Prompt Quality (1–5)**

Evaluate:

- Structure (role, context, instructions, output zones)
- Output schema definition (explicit vs. implicit)
- Instruction clarity (specific vs. vague)
- Edge case handling (addressed vs. ignored)
- Anti-patterns (wall of text, contradictions, implicit format)

**Context Efficiency (1–5)**

Evaluate:

- Context budget allocation (planned vs. ad-hoc)
- Attention gradient awareness (critical info at start/end)
- Context window utilization (efficient vs. wasteful)
- State management (explicit vs. implicit)
- Memory strategy (appropriate for conversation length)

**Tool Health (1–5)**

Evaluate:

- Tool count (3–7 ideal, 13+ problematic)
- Description quality (specific vs. vague)
- Error handling (graceful vs. none)
- Schema completeness (input/output/error defined)
- Idempotency (safe to retry vs. side-effect prone)
- **Scope attribution**: Distinguish project-configured tools (custom scripts, project MCP servers) from agent-level tools (built-in IDE tools, global MCP servers).
  Only flag tool overhead for tools the project can actually control.

**Architecture Fitness (1–5)**

Evaluate:

- Topology appropriateness (single vs. multi-agent justified)
- Agent boundaries (clear vs. overlapping)
- Handoff protocols (structured vs. ad-hoc)
- Observability (decisions logged vs. black box)
- Cost awareness (budgeted vs. unbounded)

**Safety & Reliability (1–5)**

Evaluate:

- Input validation (present vs. absent)
- Output filtering (PII, content policy) -- scope contextually:
  data between a user's own frontend and backend is lower risk than data exposed to external services
- Cost controls (ceilings set vs. unbounded)
- Error recovery (fallbacks vs. crash)
- Evaluation strategy (golden tests vs. "it seems to work")

**Scoring Guide**

| Score | Meaning                | Recommended Action                        |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 5     | Production-excellent   | No action needed                          |
| 4     | Good with minor gaps   | Polish prompt clarity or output schema    |
| 3     | Functional but risky   | Add error handling or reduce complexity   |
| 2     | Significant issues     | Immediate attention — add retries/guards  |
| 1     | Broken or missing      | Rebuild from scratch with clear structure |
