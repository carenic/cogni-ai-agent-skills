## Core Process

1. **Setup**: Use `gh aw init` to initialize a repository, followed by `gh aw new <workflow-name>` or `gh aw add-wizard`.
2. **Development**: Workflows are markdown files compiled via `gh aw compile` into GitHub Actions YAML (`.lock.yml`).
3. **Execution**: Use `gh aw run <workflow-name>` to execute a workflow or `gh aw trial` for simulated runs.
4. **Analysis**: If a run fails, use `gh aw audit <run-id-or-url>` to debug the failed run. View logs with `gh aw logs <workflow-name>`.
5. **Updating**: Run `gh aw upgrade` to get the latest agent files and apply codemods.

## What to Avoid

- Always review the changes made by the AI agent, especially considering security and context.
- Do not manually edit the generated `.lock.yml` files; they are intended to be compiled from the markdown workflows.
