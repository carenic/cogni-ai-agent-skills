# gh-aw Skill

Use `gh aw` to orchestrate GitHub Agentic Workflows for repository automation.

## When to Use

- To initialize, create, update, or run GitHub Agentic Workflows.
- When compiling `.md` agent definitions into executable `.lock.yml` GitHub Actions.
- To manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and toolsets within a repository's agent configuration.

## When Not to Use

- For standard GitHub CLI operations that don't involve the Agentic Workflows extension (e.g., just listing issues or PRs).
- When writing application code that simply uses the OpenAI or Anthropic API directly.
- For troubleshooting a failed workflow run (use `gh-aw-troubleshooting` instead).

## Common Pitfalls

- **Manual Lockfile Edits**: Directly editing the `.lock.yml` file, which will be silently overwritten the next time `gh aw compile` is run.
- **Skipping Compilation**: Changing an agent's `.md` definition but forgetting to run `gh aw compile`, causing the CI pipeline to run the outdated version.
- **Missing Extension**: Attempting to run `gh aw` commands on a fresh runner without first executing `gh extension install github/gh-aw`.

## How to Install the Extension

To install the GitHub Agentic Workflows extension for the GitHub CLI, run:

```bash
gh extension install github/gh-aw
```

If `gh extension install` is unavailable or fails (e.g., in environments
without GitHub CLI extension support), you can download and run the
installation script:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/v0.74.3/install-gh-aw.sh -o install-gh-aw.sh
head -n 50 install-gh-aw.sh # Review the script before executing
bash install-gh-aw.sh
```

## Core Process

1. **Setup**: Use `gh aw init` to initialize a repository, followed by `gh aw new <workflow-name>` or `gh aw add-wizard`.
2. **Development**: Workflows are markdown files compiled via `gh aw compile` into GitHub Actions YAML (`.lock.yml`).
3. **Execution**: Use `gh aw run <workflow-name>` to execute a workflow or `gh aw trial` for simulated runs.
4. **Analysis**: If a run fails, load the `gh-aw-troubleshooting` skill to diagnose the root cause using `gh aw audit` and `gh aw logs`.
5. **Updating**: Run `gh aw upgrade` to get the latest agent files and apply codemods.

## What to Avoid

- Always review the changes made by the AI agent, especially considering security and context.
- Do not manually edit the generated `.lock.yml` files; they are intended to be compiled from the markdown workflows.
