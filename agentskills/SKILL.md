# Agent Skills (Standard)

The Agent Skills open standard provides a framework for structuring and specifying skills to ensure portability across different AI systems and agent hosts.

## Core Principles

- **Open Standard**: Rely on the open standard for structure and specifications to ensure portability across different AI systems.
- **Portability**: Keep scripts self-contained within the skill folder to allow sharing and avoid referencing external absolute paths.
- **Non-Interactive Execution**: Always design skills for non-interactive flow, using specific arguments or flags to avoid stalling the agent.
- **Pre-flight Inspection**: Always inspect third-party skills before installing to verify content safety and avoid malicious instructions or scripts.
- **Supply Chain Integrity**: Prefer pinning skills to specific tags or commit SHAs to ensure deterministic behavior.
- **Portable Provenance**: Skills should include tracking metadata (repository, ref, tree SHA) in the `SKILL.md` frontmatter to allow tracking even if files are moved.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Structure skills so detail is loaded only as needed:
  1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): `name` and `description` are loaded at startup.
  2. **Instructions** (< 5000 tokens): `SKILL.md` body is loaded when the skill is activated.
  3. **Resources** (as needed): Scripts, references, or assets are loaded only when required.

## Core Process (Manual Creation)

1. **Determine Scope**:
   - **Project-specific**: Stored in `.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/`. Scope is limited to the repository.
   - **Personal**: Stored in `~/.copilot/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/`. Scope is global for the user's CLI environment.
2. **Scaffold Skill**:
   - Create a directory named after the skill (lowercase-hyphenated).
   - Create a `SKILL.md` file with the required YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`).
   - Add any supporting scripts or resources within the same directory.
3. **Verify Structure**: Ensure the `SKILL.md` follows the standard sections and style (imperative, dense, expert-level).

## Directory Structure

A standard skill directory should be organized as follows:

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: metadata + instructions
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code (Python, Bash, JS)
├── references/       # Optional: additional documentation
├── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources, images
└── ...               # Any additional files or directories
```

## Skill Structure & Formatting

### `SKILL.md` Frontmatter

| Field | Required | Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name` | Yes | 1-64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only. No start/end hyphens. |
| `description` | Yes | 1-1024 chars. Should describe what the skill does AND when to use it. |
| `license` | No | License name or reference to a bundled license file. |
| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars. System packages, network access needs, etc. |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value mapping (e.g., author, version). |
| `allowed-tools` | No | (Experimental) Space-separated string of pre-approved tools. |

### Body Content

- Use imperative, dense, expert-level instructions.
- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines to preserve context window.
- Recommended sections: step-by-step instructions, examples, edge cases.

## File References

- Use relative paths from the skill root (e.g., `[reference](references/REF.md)`).
- Keep file references one level deep from `SKILL.md` if possible.
- Avoid deeply nested reference chains.

## Directory Scopes

| Level | Location | Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Project | `.github/skills/` | Single repository |
| Personal | `~/.copilot/skills/` | User-wide (CLI) |
| System | `/usr/share/agents/skills/` | System-wide |

## Validation

Use the `skills-ref` reference library to validate skills locally:

```bash
skills-ref validate ./my-skill
```

## What to Avoid

- Placing project-specific skills in global directories.
- Referencing external absolute paths in scripts inside a skill folder.
- Hardcoding environment-specific values that break portability.
- Including interactive scripts that require user input.
