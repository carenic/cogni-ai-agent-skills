# Agent Skills (Standard)

The Agent Skills open standard provides a framework for structuring and specifying skills to ensure portability across different AI systems and agent hosts. Agent Skills are self-contained folders with instructions and bundled resources that teach AI agents specialized capabilities, unlike custom instructions which only define coding standards.

## Core Principles

- **Open Standard**: Rely on the open standard for structure and specifications to ensure portability across different AI systems.
- **Portability**: Keep scripts self-contained within the skill folder to allow sharing and avoid referencing external absolute paths.
- **Non-Interactive Execution**: Always design skills for non-interactive flow, using specific arguments or flags to avoid stalling the agent.
- **Pre-flight Inspection**: Always inspect third-party skills before installing to verify content safety and avoid malicious instructions or scripts.
- **Supply Chain Integrity**: Prefer pinning skills to specific tags or commit SHAs to ensure deterministic behavior.
- **Portable Provenance**: Skills should include tracking metadata (repository, ref, tree SHA) in the `SKILL.md` frontmatter to allow tracking even if files are moved.
- **Progressive Loading Architecture**: Structure skills so detail is loaded only as needed:
  1. **Discovery** (~100 tokens): `name` and `description` are loaded at startup.
  2. **Instructions** (< 5000 tokens): `SKILL.md` body is loaded when the request matches the description.
  3. **Resources** (as needed): Scripts, examples, and docs are loaded only when explicitly referenced.

## Core Process (Manual Creation)

1. **Determine Scope**:
   - **Project skills**: Stored in `.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/` depending on the tool. Scope is limited to the repository.
   - **Personal skills**: Stored in `~/.copilot/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, or `~/.agents/skills/` depending on the tool. Scope is global for the user's CLI environment.
   - **Installable skills**: Use `gh skill add https://docs-url` (using the `gh skill` extension) or `npx skills add https://docs-url` (Vercel's skills CLI) to install external skills.
2. **Scaffold Skill**:
   - Create a directory named after the skill (lowercase-hyphenated).
   - Create a `SKILL.md` file with the required YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`).
   - Add any supporting scripts or resources within the same directory.
3. **Verify Structure**: Ensure the `SKILL.md` follows the standard sections and style (imperative, dense, expert-level).

## Directory Structure

A standard skill directory should be organized as follows:

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: metadata + instructions
├── LICENSE.txt       # Recommended: License terms (Apache 2.0 typical)
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code (Python, Bash, JS). Loaded when executed.
├── references/       # Optional: additional documentation. Loaded when referenced.
├── assets/           # Optional: static files used AS-IS in output (not modified by agent).
└── templates/        # Optional: starter code/scaffolds that the AI agent MODIFIES.
```

**Assets vs Templates**: If the AI agent reads and builds upon the file content, place it in `templates/`. If the file is used as-is in output (e.g., logo.png, report format), place it in `assets/`.

## Skill Structure & Formatting

### Agent profile format (Frontmatter)

The `name` and `description` fields in `SKILL.md` frontmatter are critical. The agent decides whether to load a skill based on the description alone. A vague description means the skill never activates. Write descriptions that specify both when the skill applies and when it does not.

**CRITICAL**: Keep descriptions concise and keyword-dense to respect the context budget. Describe **WHAT** the skill does, **WHEN** to use it, and include relevant **KEYWORDS**.

| Field | Required | Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name` | Yes | 1-64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only. No start/end hyphens. |
| `description` | Yes | 10-1024 chars. Should describe capabilities AND use cases. Wrapped in single quotes. |
| `license` | No | License name or reference to a bundled license file (e.g., `Complete terms in LICENSE.txt`). |
| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars. System packages, network access needs, etc. |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value mapping (e.g., author, version). |
| `allowed-tools` | No | (Experimental) Space-separated string of pre-approved tools. |

### Body Content

- Use imperative mood ("Run", "Create", "Configure"), dense, expert-level instructions.
- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines to preserve context window. Split into `references/` if it exceeds ~200 lines.
- **Focus on What Copilot Doesn't Know**: Exclude standard language syntax or well-documented API behavior. Focus on internal conventions, non-obvious defaults, version-specific quirks, and domain-specific workflows.

Recommended sections:
- `# Title`: Brief overview of what this skill enables.
- `## When to Use This Skill`: List of scenarios reinforcing description triggers.
- `## Prerequisites`: Required tools or dependencies.
- `## Step-by-Step Workflows`: Numbered steps for repeatable procedures (build, deploy, setup). Use flexible guidelines instead of rigid steps for open-ended tasks.
- `## Gotchas`: Proactive warnings about non-obvious behavior. **This is the highest-signal content**. Bold the key constraint and explain why.
- `## Troubleshooting`: Reactive fixes for known issues (symptom → solution pairs).
- `## References`: Links to bundled docs (`references/`) or external resources.

## File References

- Use relative paths from the skill root (e.g., `[reference](./references/REF.md)`).
- Keep file references one level deep from `SKILL.md` if possible.
- Avoid deeply nested reference chains.

## Directory Scopes

| Level | Location | Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Project (Shared) | `.agents/skills/` | Single repository, portable across agents |
| Project (Provider) | `.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/` | Single repository, provider-specific |
| Project (Runtime) | `.skills/` | Ephemeral workspace symlink (e.g., CI/CD) |
| Personal (Shared) | `~/.agents/skills/` | User-wide (CLI), portable across agents |
| Personal (Provider) | `~/.github/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.copilot/skills/`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | User-wide (CLI), provider-specific |
| Installable | `gh skill add https://docs-url`, `npx skills add https://docs-url` | Install external skills via CLI |
| System | `/usr/share/agents/skills/` | System-wide |

## Runtime and CI/CD Caveats

- **Discoverability**: In CI/CD environments (like GitHub Actions), agents may run with workspace-scoped tools. If skills are cloned outside the workspace (e.g., `${{ runner.temp }}/.skills`), they should be symlinked into the workspace (e.g., `.skills/`) to be discoverable by the agent.
- **Trust Boundaries**: When running agent workflows on `pull_request_target` or `issue_comment` triggers, the PR branch's `.github/skills/` and `.github/instructions/` might be checked out by platform tools. Ensure base branch skills are preserved to prevent malicious forks from injecting altered skills.

## Validation Checklist

Before publishing a skill, verify:
- [ ] `SKILL.md` has valid frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- [ ] `name` is lowercase with hyphens, ≤64 characters
- [ ] `description` clearly states **WHAT** it does, **WHEN** to use it, and relevant **KEYWORDS**
- [ ] Body focuses on information Copilot wouldn't know from training data
- [ ] `## Gotchas` section present if skill involves non-obvious behavior, API quirks, or common traps
- [ ] SKILL.md body under 500 lines (consider splitting into `references/` at ~200 lines)
- [ ] Large workflows (>5 steps) split into `references/` folder with clear links
- [ ] Scripts include help documentation and error handling
- [ ] Relative paths used for all resource references

Locally validate skills using the `skills-ref` reference library:
```bash
skills-ref validate ./my-skill
```

## What to Avoid

- Placing project-specific skills in global directories.
- Referencing external absolute paths in scripts inside a skill folder.
- Hardcoding environment-specific values that break portability.
- Including interactive scripts that require user input.
- Including information the agent already knows from its training data.
