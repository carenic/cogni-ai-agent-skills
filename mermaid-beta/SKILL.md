## Diagram Types & Patterns

### Architecture Diagrams

An Architecture diagram is specialized for mapping out topological structures,
infrastructure components, and their network or logical relationships.

- Use `architecture-beta` to initialize the diagram.
- Define logical groupings using `group <alias>(<icon>)[<Label>]`.
- Define individual services using `service <alias>(<icon>)[<Label>]`.
- Nest a service inside a group by appending `in <group_alias>`.
- Connect components by specifying their connection sides (`L`, `R`, `T`, `B`)
  separated by `--` (e.g., `serviceA:R -- L:serviceB`).

Example mapping out a cloud-based serverless architecture:

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group aws(cloud)[AWS Cloud]

    service gateway(internet)[API Gateway] in aws
    service lambda(server)[Compute Logic] in aws
    service db(database)[Database] in aws
    service storage(disk)[Storage Container] in aws

    gateway:B -- T:lambda
    lambda:R -- L:db
    lambda:L -- R:storage
```

Docs: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/architecture.html>

### Block Diagrams

A Block diagram is well-suited for visualizing architectures, systems, or process
flows by arranging blocks in a customizable grid layout.

- Use `block-beta` to initialize the diagram type.
- Define grid columns using `columns <number>` (e.g., `columns 3`).
- Define blocks by using an ID, optionally with text and shape (e.g., `DB(("Database"))`).
- Group blocks within a parent block using `block:<ID>` or `block:<ID>:<width>` and close with `end`.
- Use `space` or `space:<number>` to skip grid columns.
- Connect blocks using arrows (e.g., `A --> B`) and apply styles using the `style` directive.

Example demonstrating a grid-based architecture layout:

```mermaid
block-beta
columns 3
  Client
  space
  Internet

  block:Server:3
    API
    space:2
    Logic
  end

  Database

  Client --> Internet
  Internet --> Server
  Server --> Database
```

Docs: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/block.html>

### Ishikawa Diagram (v11.12.3+)

An Ishikawa diagram (also known as a fishbone or cause-and-effect diagram) is used
to represent the causes of a specific event or problem.

- Use `ishikawa-beta` to initialize the diagram type.
- The first line after the declaration represents the main event or problem (the "head").
- Subsequent lines are the major categories of causes.
- Indent lines to create nested "fishbone" sub-causes under their parent categories.

Example mapping out the causes of a website outage:

```mermaid
ishikawa-beta
    Website Outage
    Infrastructure
        Server Crash
        Network Failure
    Code
        Bug in Deployment
        Configuration Error
    External
        DDoS Attack
        Third-party API Down
```

Docs: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/ishikawa.html>

### Packet Diagram

A Packet diagram is typically used to visualize network protocols or binary data
structures, showing the bits and bytes that make up headers or payloads.

- Use `packet-beta` to initialize the diagram type.
- Add an optional `title` to describe the structure.
- Define bits mapping using ranges representing bit boundaries (e.g., `0-7`).
- Add descriptive labels for each bit range (e.g., `0-7: "Field Name"`).
- The diagram automatically wraps fields into 32-bit rows by default.

Example using a binary block, such as the PNG magic signature file header:

```mermaid
packet-beta
    title "PNG File Signature (8 bytes)"
    0-7: "0x89 (High Bit Set)"
    8-15: "0x50 ('P')"
    16-23: "0x4E ('N')"
    24-31: "0x47 ('G')"
    32-39: "0x0D (CR)"
    40-47: "0x0A (LF)"
    48-55: "0x1A (EOF)"
    56-63: "0x0A (LF)"
```

Docs: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/packet.html>

### Radar Diagram (v11.6.0+)

A Radar diagram (or spider chart) is a graphical method of displaying multivariate data
in the form of a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented
on axes starting from the same central point.

- Use `radar-beta` to initialize the diagram.
- Include an optional `title` to identify what the radar chart represents.
- Specify the variable categories along the perimeter using `axis` and a comma-separated list.
- Provide the numeric datasets for each entity using `curve <label> {values}`.

Example representing a team skill assessment:

```mermaid
radar-beta
    title "Skill Assessment"
    axis Communication, Technical, Teamwork, Leadership, Time_Management
    curve Alice {8, 9, 7, 6, 8}
    curve Bob {6, 8, 9, 8, 7}
```

Docs: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/radar.html>

### Sankey Diagram

A Sankey diagram is a flow diagram in which the width of the bands is proportional
to the flow rate. It is typically used to visualize energy, material, or cost
transfers between processes.

- Use `sankey-beta` to initialize the diagram.
- Define flows using comma-separated values in the format `source, target, value`.
- The `value` specifies the thickness of the connection between nodes.
- Define nodes via their usage; no prior declaration is needed.

Example visualizing energy flows:

```mermaid
sankey-beta
    Renewables, Grid, 50
    Fossil Fuels, Grid, 30
    Nuclear, Grid, 20
    Grid, Commercial, 40
    Grid, Residential, 35
    Grid, Industrial, 25
```

Docs: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sankey.html>

### Treemap Diagram

A Treemap diagram represents hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles, where
the area of each rectangle is proportional to its value.

- Use `treemap-beta` to initialize the diagram type.
- Define hierarchical structures using consistent indentation. Ensure string labels are enclosed in double quotes.
- Specify values for leaf nodes by appending a colon and a number after the label (`"label": <value>`).
- The diagram will automatically calculate the size of parent nodes based on their children.

Example representing a company's budget breakdown:

```mermaid
treemap-beta
  "Marketing"
    "Social Media": 20000
    "Email Campaigns": 5000
  "R&D"
    "New Features": 40000
    "Maintenance": 15000
  "Operations"
    "Software Licenses": 10000
    "Hardware": 5000
```

Docs: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/treemap.html>

### TreeView Diagram (v11.14.0+)

A TreeView diagram is used to represent hierarchical data in the form of a directory-like structure.

- Use `treeView-beta` to initialize the diagram type.
- Define items as strings enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"folder name"`).
- Establish hierarchy and parent-child relationships purely through line indentation.

Example mapping out a project directory structure:

```mermaid
treeView-beta
    "src"
        "components"
            "Header.tsx"
            "Footer.tsx"
        "utils"
            "helpers.ts"
    "tests"
        "unit"
    "package.json"
    "README.md"
```

Docs: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/treeView.html>

### Venn Diagrams (v11.12.3+)

Venn diagrams visually represent the relationships between sets using overlapping circles.

- Use `venn-beta` to initialize the diagram type.
- Define a single set using the `set` keyword (e.g., `set Frontend`).
- Define the overlap of two or more sets using `union` (e.g., `union Frontend,Backend`).
- Custom display labels can be assigned using bracket syntax (e.g., `set Dev["Developers"]`).
- Specify sizes for sets or unions by appending a suffix `:N` (e.g., `set Dev:20`).
- Place additional labels inside a set or union using the `text` keyword on an indented line.

Example representing overlapping capabilities:

```mermaid
venn-beta
    title "DevOps Culture"
    set Dev["Development"]:10
    set Ops["Operations"]:10
    set QA["Quality Assurance"]:8

    union Dev,Ops["Continuous Delivery"]:4
    union Dev,QA["Test Automation"]:3
    union Ops,QA["Environments"]:3
    union Dev,Ops,QA["Cross-Functional"]:2
```

Docs: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/venn.html>

### XY Chart

An XY chart is an essential data visualization tool that lets you depict data points
on Cartesian coordinates. It supports visualizing data using line charts and bar charts.

- Use `xychart-beta` to initialize the diagram.
- Define an optional `title` to describe the chart.
- Specify the `x-axis` with specific categories (e.g., `[Jan, Feb]`) or a range.
- Specify the `y-axis` with an optional title and range (e.g., `"Revenue" 0 --> 100`).
- Add data series by using `bar` or `line` followed by an array of values (`[10, 20]`).

Example illustrating monthly sales and targets:

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Monthly Sales and Targets"
    x-axis [Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun]
    y-axis "Revenue (in $)" 0 --> 10000
    bar [5000, 6000, 7500, 8200, 9500, 8800]
    line [4000, 5000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 8500]
```

Docs: <https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/xyChart.html>

### ZenUML

ZenUML is an extension that allows you to write sequence diagrams
using a declarative pseudo-code syntax, focusing on speed and readability.
**Important**: ZenUML is an external integration. It requires importing the `@mermaid-js/mermaid-zenuml` plugin
and registering it with `mermaid.registerExternalDiagrams()` before it can be rendered by viewers.

- Use `zenuml` to initialize the diagram type.
- Add an optional `title` to label the diagram.
- Use `A->B: message` or `A->B: method() { ... }` for synchronous or asynchronous messages.
- Utilize programming constructs like `if (condition)`, `else`, `for`, `while`,
  and `try/catch` to build complex flow logic naturally.
- Use `return` statements to denote explicit responses.

Example of a ZenUML Sequence Diagram:

```mermaid
zenuml
    title Authentication Flow
    Client->Server: authenticate(credentials) {
        if (isValid) {
            Server->Database: fetchUser()
            return token
        } else {
            return error
        }
    }
```
