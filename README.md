# Cogni AI Agent Skills

[![PR Reviews][pr-reviews-image]][pr-reviews-link]
[![License][license-image]][license-link]

The primary purpose of this project/repository is to maintain technical skills commonly
used by AI agents to learn technical IT skills. These skills can be loaded into any
other repository by placing them into the `.github/skills/` directory, ideally
integrating this repository as a Git submodule.

This repository mirrors the structure and conventions of the
[Cogni-AI-OU/.github](https://github.com/Cogni-AI-OU/.github) organization repository.

## Installation

To set up the required agents, instructions, and skills in your repository:

```bash
# Clone agents, instructions and skills.
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Cogni-AI-OU/cogni-ai-agents .github/agents
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Cogni-AI-OU/cogni-ai-agent-instructions .github/instructions
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Cogni-AI-OU/cogni-ai-agent-skills .github/skills

# Symlink individual agents from their subdirectories to the discovery directory.
for d in .github/agents/*/ ; do ln -fsv "$(basename "$d")/$(basename "$d").agent.md" .github/agents/ ; done
```

After cloning the repositories, your project will have access to the full suite of
Cogni AI capabilities loaded into the `.github/` directory.

### Agent Configuration Files

| File/Directory | Audience | Purpose |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- |
| [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) | All agents | Repository-specific guidance and workflows |
| [AGENTS-RUNTIME.md](AGENTS-RUNTIME.md) | GitHub Runtime agents | Skill loading instructions and catalog |
| [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) | Copilot | Coding standards and project context |

See also:

- [`AGENTS.md` file format specification](https://agents.md/)
- [Best practices for using GitHub Copilot](https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips).

### Agent Skills

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that GitHub
Copilot can load when relevant to improve its performance in specialized tasks.

Agent Skills work with:

- [Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent)
- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli)
- Agent mode in Visual Studio Code

For more information, see
[About Agent Skills](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills).

#### Skills catalog

The full, machine-readable list of skills lives in [AGENTS-RUNTIME.md](AGENTS-RUNTIME.md). Use it when you need the
authoritative catalog for agent loading. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) provides repository-specific guidance.
This README stays human-focused.

#### Creating skills

Each skill lives in its own subdirectory and must contain a `SKILL.md` file with
YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: Brief description of when Copilot should use this skill
license: MIT
---

Instructions for Copilot to follow when this skill is activated.
```

##### SKILL.md frontmatter

| Field | Required | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens for spaces) |
| `description` | Yes | What the skill does and when to use it |
| `license` | No | License that applies to this skill |

#### Skill locations

Skills can be stored at different levels:

| Level | Location | Scope |
| ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Project | Root directory (`/`) | Single repository |
| Personal | `~/.copilot/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/` | All projects (CLI only) |

#### How Copilot uses skills

Copilot decides when to use skills based on your prompt and the skill's
description. When activated, the `SKILL.md` file is injected into the agent's
context, providing access to your instructions and any scripts or examples in
the skill's directory.

#### Skills vs custom instructions

- **Custom instructions** (`copilot-instructions.md`): Simple guidance relevant
  to almost every task (coding standards, repository conventions)
- **Skills**: Detailed instructions that Copilot accesses only when relevant to
  a specific task

#### Community resources

Find and share skills with the community:

- [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) - Reference skills
  repository
- [github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) - Community
  collection of Copilot resources

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Not Responding to Comments

If Claude isn't responding to your comments, verify:

1. **Permissions**: You must have one of these roles:
   - Repository OWNER, MEMBER, COLLABORATOR, or CONTRIBUTOR
   - PR/issue author (on your own content only)

2. **Trigger conditions** for PR review comments:
   - Your comment contains `@claude`, OR
   - You're replying to a comment from `github-actions[bot]` (Claude's responses), OR
   - You're replying to a comment that contains `@claude`

The workflow uses a two-stage filter to prevent abuse while allowing natural
conversation flow. Check the Actions tab in your repository for workflow run details
if Claude doesn't respond as expected.
