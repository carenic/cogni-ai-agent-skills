# Advanced Git Operations

Expert-level guidance for executing complex Git operations safely and effectively.

## Interactive Rebasing (`git rebase -i`)

- **Objective**: Clean up local commit history before pushing.
- **Process**:
  - **WARNING**: Interactive modes (`-i`) are FORBIDDEN in runtime automation. Ensure `-i` is strictly scoped to
    local manual-only usage or fixing in the non-github runtime (like in local agent or devcontainer runtime).
  - Start manual rebase: `git rebase -i <base-commit-or-branch>`
  - Automated rewrites: Set `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true` for non-interactive execution if scripted.
  - Actions: `pick`, `reword`, `edit`, `squash` (or `s`), `fixup` (or `f`), `drop`.
- **Safety**: NEVER rebase commits that have already been pushed to a shared public
  branch unless explicitly coordinating a force-push.
- **Abort**: `git rebase --abort`

## Reflog Recovery (`git reflog`)

- **Objective**: Recover lost commits, branches, or undo a destructive operation (like a bad hard reset).
- **Process**:
  - View history of HEAD movements: `git reflog`
  - Identify the target commit SHA (e.g., `HEAD@{2}`).
  - Restore state: `git reset --hard <sha>` or create a branch: `git branch <branch-name> <sha>`.

## Bisecting (`git bisect`)

- **Objective**: Use binary search to find the exact commit that introduced a bug.
- **Process**:
  - Start: `git bisect start`
  - Mark broken commit (usually current): `git bisect bad`
  - Mark known good commit: `git bisect good <good-commit-sha>`
  - Git will checkout intermediate commits. Test, then mark `git bisect good` or `git bisect bad`.
  - Conclude: `git bisect reset` to return to the original branch.

## Advanced Cherry-Picking

- **Objective**: Apply specific commits from one branch to another without merging the whole branch.
- **Process**: `git cherry-pick <commit-sha>`
- **Multiple commits**: `git cherry-pick <sha-A>^..<sha-B>`
- **No commit (stage only)**: `git cherry-pick -n <commit-sha>`

## Complex Troubleshooting

- **Corrupted Repository Recovery**: For errors like `fatal: bad object refs/heads/...`,
  `object file is empty`, or `git did not send all necessary objects`.
  - **Diagnose**: Run `git fsck --full` to identify missing/corrupted objects or refs.
  - **Backup first**: From the parent directory, back up the entire repository:
    `cp -a <repo-name> <repo-name>.bak` before destructive commands.
  - **Empty Objects**: Delete zero-byte objects blocking pulls with
    `find .git/objects/ -type f -empty -delete`.
  - **Bad Refs/Heads**: Check for corrupted or duplicate branch refs (e.g., from cloud-sync
    like iCloud/Dropbox). Delete broken refs (e.g., `rm .git/refs/heads/dev` or
    `git update-ref -d refs/heads/dev`), then `git fetch -p` to restore.
  - **Finalize Repair**: If local index/HEAD is corrupted, `rm -rf .git/index` and
    `git reset --hard origin/<branch>`.
- **Detached HEAD**: If work is committed in a detached head, immediately create a branch
  before checking out anything else: `git branch backup-branch`.
- **Untracked files overwriting**: If a checkout/pull is blocked by untracked files, stash
  them (`git stash push -u`) or clean (`git clean -fd` - **destructive**).
- **Accidental Force Push**: Look for previous commit SHA in local terminal history, local
  `git reflog` (if same machine), or GitHub PR/Issue events to restore.

## Extracting a Subdirectory with History (Subtree/Filter-Branch)

- **Objective**: Extract a specific subdirectory from an external repository and merge it into another repository's root,
  permanently preserving the git commit history of those files.
- **Process**:
  1. **Fallback Tool**: When `git filter-repo` or `git subtree` are unavailable, `git filter-branch` serves as a
     reliable built-in fallback.
  2. **Clone Source**: Clone the external repository into a temporary directory and navigate into it:
     `git clone --depth 50 <url> temp-repo && cd temp-repo`
  3. **Rewrite History**: Isolate the target subdirectory so it becomes the root of the temporary repository:
     `export FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1`
     `git filter-branch -f --subdirectory-filter <path> HEAD`
  4. **Add Remote**: Navigate back to your main repository and add the temporary clone as a new remote:
     `cd /path/to/main && git remote add temp-repo /path/to/temp-repo`
  5. **Merge**: Fetch and merge the isolated history into your main repository:
     `git fetch temp-repo && git merge temp-repo/main --allow-unrelated-histories`
- **Challenges & Solutions**:
  - **Tool Availability**: Modern tools (`filter-repo`, `subtree`) may be missing. `filter-branch` provides a built-in
    albeit older solution.
  - **Root File Conflicts**: Files pulled from the target subdirectory may conflict with your main repository if they
    share generic names (e.g., `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`). Handle these deliberately (e.g., `git checkout --ours README.md`).
  - **Hook Interference**: Pre-commit hooks might trigger heavily on the newly merged files. Use `--no-verify` on the
    merge commit if the upstream is already trusted, followed by independent linting to avoid timeout crashes in
    constrained environments.

## Verification

- Always verify the workspace state with `git status` and history with `git log --oneline --graph -n 15` after altering history.
- Ensure all automated actions gracefully handle conflicts by checking exit codes.
