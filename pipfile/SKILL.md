# pipfile

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD023 MD031 MD032 -->

Use this skill for managing the structure and content of `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files.

## Core Process

1. **Structure Definition**: Define the `Pipfile` structure including source, packages, and dev-packages.
2. **Locking**: Ensure all dependencies are pinned in `Pipfile.lock` using deterministic hashing.
3. **Manual Edits**: Manually editing the `Pipfile` is allowed but must adhere strictly to standard TOML syntax.

## Core Principles

- **Deterministic Environments**: Rely on `Pipfile.lock` to guarantee exact versions and hashes. Never edit `Pipfile.lock` manually.
- **Group Separation**: Strictly separate production (`[packages]`) and development (`[dev-packages]`) dependencies.
- **TOML Compliance**: Manually editing the `Pipfile` is allowed but must adhere strictly to standard TOML syntax. Prefer CLI commands over manual edits when possible.
- **Security-First**: Utilize `Pipfile.lock`'s stored hashes to prevent supply-chain attacks. Regularly run vulnerability scans.
- **CI/CD Invariance**: Use `--deploy` to ensure `Pipfile.lock` is up-to-date and fails if not. Use `--system` when running in Docker containers.

## What to Avoid

- **Interactive Subshells**: As an automated agent, you MUST NOT run `pipenv shell`.
- **Manual Lockfile Edits**: NEVER manually edit `Pipfile.lock`.
- **Using requirements.txt blindly**: Migrate dependencies to the `Pipfile` structure instead of using legacy formats.
