# Fact Writer

Guidance for structuring and maintaining verifiable project fact files. Use this skill when managing `FACTS.md`,
`FACTS.mmd`, or similar canonical stores.

## When to Activate

- Creating or updating canonical fact stores (e.g., `FACTS.md`, `FACTS.mmd`).
- Documenting verifiable ecosystem properties, constraints, or architectural decisions.
- Resolving state conflicts or contradictions within documentation limits.

## Core Process

1. **Verify State**:
    Read existing fact files entirely before proposing updates; never infer missing state.
2. **Contradiction Transparency**:
    Surface conflicts immediately; reject silent overwrites when a proposed fact contradicts an existing `A ≠ ¬A` state.
    Replace, do not append.
3. **Verifiable Facts Only**:
    Record objective facts grounded in repository configuration, code, and explicit documentation. Zero subjective prose.
4. **Structured Format**:
    Enforce rigid hierarchical structures (e.g., Mermaid `mindmap` or perfectly nested Markdown lists). Group by logical
    domains like `Architecture`, `Context`, `Ecosystem`.
5. **Lexical Sorting**:
    Insert new facts in strict alphabetical order within their domain/level.
    - **Case**: Case-insensitive (e.g., `A` and `a` share same priority; `App` before `apple`).
    - **Numbers**: Natural sort (e.g., `v2` < `v10`).
    - **Special Characters**: Sort symbols (e.g., `@`, `_`) before alphanumeric characters.
6. **Reversibility Focus**:
    Offload history, diffs, and rollback logic entirely to Git. Eradicate historical changelogs, sequence IDs, and
    obsolete states from the fact file itself.

## Diagnostics and Revisions

- **Contradiction Sweep**: Pre-commit self-review to guarantee zero logical conflicts.
- **Orphan Pruning**: Seamlessly drop redundant, outdated, or superseded facts (e.g., deprecated libraries) to
  maintain high-density state compression.

## What to Avoid

- **NEVER** insert nodes or lists out of alphabetical order.
- **NEVER** include conversational prose, narratives, or explanations in fact structures.
- **NEVER** hallucinate project details. If unsupported by repo state, reject ingestion.
- **NEVER** preserve historical states when superseded. Replace with the new fact.
