name: gh
description: >-
  Use when planning or executing GitHub CLI (`gh`) commands for issues, pull
  requests, workflow runs, reviews, or API queries, especially in restricted
  shells where structured output and fallback choice matter.

# gh Skill

Use `gh` as a structured client first. Prefer native fields, explicit routing,
and bounded fallbacks over brittle shell post-processing.

## When to Activate

- User asks to use `gh`, GitHub CLI, or to query GitHub from shell.
- Task involves issues, PRs, reviews, workflow runs, jobs, discussions, or GitHub REST endpoints.
- Execution is inside CI, Codespaces, or another restricted shell.

## Core Process

1. Verify availability and auth first: `gh --version`, then `gh auth status`.
2. Choose the narrowest native `gh` surface before reaching for `gh api`:
   - `gh issue view/comment` for issues
   - `gh pr view/comment/review` for pull requests and reviews
   - `gh api` only when native subcommands do not expose the needed field
3. Prefer structured output over shell filtering:
   - use `--json`, `--jq`, or `--template` instead of `grep`/`rg`
   - use `gh api` for metadata, not ad hoc HTML scraping
4. Query the smallest object that answers the question:
   - issue or PR metadata before comments
5. After each command, verify progress explicitly:
   - non-empty stdout or expected JSON field
   - no warning that changes command semantics
   - result actually answers the current question
6. If the same normalized command shape fails twice with the same warning,
   error, or empty result, pivot strategy instead of retrying.

## API Parameter Handling

When using `gh api` (including `gh api graphql`), choose the correct flag for parameters:

- Use `-F` (`--field`) for **magic type conversion**:
  - **File expansion**: `-F body=@path/to/file.md` (reads file content).
  - **Typed values**: `-F is_public=true`, `-F count=42`, `-F parent=null`.
  - **Placeholders**: `-F repo={repo}`, `-F owner={owner}`.
- Use `-f` (`--raw-field`) for **static strings**:
  - Use this when you want the literal value.
  - **CAUTION**: `-f` DOES NOT expand `@`. Using `-f body=@file` posts the literal string "@file".
  - For GraphQL, `query` is usually passed with `-f` to avoid accidental expansion or type conversion of the query string itself.

**Large Bodies & Files**:
- Prefer `-F body=@path/to/file.md` for large content.
- **Process Substitution**: Avoid `-F body=@<(...)` in `gh api`; it is brittle across shells. Write to a temporary file first, then use `-F body=@tempfile`.

**GraphQL Variables**:
For `gh api graphql`, all fields other than `query` and `operationName` are automatically passed as GraphQL variables.
Example: `gh api graphql -f query='mutation($title: String!) { ... }' -F title=@title.txt`

## Structured Query Patterns

- Use `gh pr view <number> --json headRefName,baseRefName,commits` to extract PR commit history
  (e.g. for visualization to generate topology data like `mermaid` `gitGraph` diagrams without cloning explicitly)
- Prefer native JSON first:
  - `gh issue view <number> --json comments,number,title,state,author,url`
  - `gh pr view <number> --json number,title,state,reviewDecision,url`
- Use `gh api` for objects that native subcommands do not expose cleanly:
  - `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>/comments`
- Use `--jq` or `--template` before external filters.

## Discussion Patterns (via GraphQL)

Since `gh` often lacks a native `discussion` subcommand, use `gh api graphql`. Avoid process substitution for the body; use a temporary file.

- **Get repositoryId and categoryId**:
  ```bash
  gh api graphql -f query='query {
    repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
      id
      discussionCategories(first: 10) {
        nodes { id name }
      }
    }
  }'
  ```
- **Create Discussion**:
  ```bash
  gh api graphql -F repositoryId="$REPO_ID" -F categoryId="$CAT_ID" \
    -F title="Title" -F body=@body.md \
    -f query='mutation($repositoryId:ID!, $categoryId:ID!, $title:String!, $body:String!){
      createDiscussion(input:{repositoryId:$repositoryId,categoryId:$categoryId,title:$title,body:$body}){
        discussion{url}
      }
    }'
  ```
- **Comment on Discussion**:
  ```bash
  gh api graphql -F discussionId="$DISCUSSION_ID" -F body=@comment.md \
    -f query='mutation($discussionId:ID!, $body:String!){
      addDiscussionComment(input:{discussionId:$discussionId,body:$body}){
        comment{url}
      }
    }'
  ```

## Preferred Patterns

- Comment directly without touching workspace files:
  `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- Reply through the originating GitHub surface:
  - issue thread -> `gh issue comment`
  - PR thread -> `gh pr comment` or `gh pr review`
  - inline review thread -> `gh api .../replies`
- For long comments, use a HEREDOC body:
  `gh issue comment <number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
  ...
  EOF
  )"`
- For GraphQL mutations with large bodies from files:
  `gh api graphql -f query='mutation($body: String!) { ... }' -F body=@file.md`
- For non-code-change tasks, verify workspace cleanliness after posting.

## GitHub Actions Runtime

When executing autonomously within a GitHub Actions environment, adhere strictly to these interaction constraints:

### OpenCode PR Context & Response Routing

**Context & Targeting Invariants**:

- **Extract Context**: Parse the `## Pull Request Context` block containing `**Base Branch:**` dynamically.
- **Dynamic PR Targeting**: ALWAYS target this explicitly provided **Base Branch** when creating/updating PRs.

**Response Detection & Routing**: Check `github.event_name` and payload to identify trigger source:

- **General PR comment** (`issue_comment`):
  - Condition: `if: ${{ github.event.issue.pull_request }}`
  - Reply Method: `gh pr comment`
- **Issue comment** (`issue_comment`):
  - Condition: `if: ${{ !github.event.issue.pull_request }}`
  - Reply Method: `gh issue comment`
- **Inline code review** (`pull_request_review_comment`):
  - Reply Method: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies -f body="..."`

**Routing Invariants**:

- **Symmetric Routing**: ALWAYS reply via the exact originating channel. NEVER cross threads.
- Parse `github.event.comment.id` and `in_reply_to_id` to maintain thread continuity.

### Branch Sync Policy (No Rebase During Runtime)

When the prompt asks to "pull" or "sync with base" in GitHub Actions runtime, the
agent MUST integrate remote changes with a merge commit workflow.

- **MUST NOT** run any rebase-based update command during runtime.
- **FORBIDDEN**: `gh pr update-branch --rebase`, `git pull --rebase`, `git rebase`,
  or any history rewrite that changes commit SHAs.
- **MUST** use pull-with-merge semantics: `git pull --no-rebase`.
- **MUST** preserve remote branch compatibility for post-run auto PR/push logic.

**Execution Steps (strict order)**:

1. Determine PR base/head from context (`## Pull Request Context`, `gh pr view`).
2. Ensure work is on the PR head branch (not detached HEAD).
3. Sync head branch from remote with merge semantics: `git pull --no-rebase origin <head-branch>`.
4. If base changes must be integrated into head, merge base explicitly:
   `git fetch origin <base-branch> && git merge --no-ff origin/<base-branch>`.
5. Resolve conflicts, commit merge if required, then push normally (no force).

**Verification Gate (required before push)**:

- Confirm no rebase command was executed in this run.
- Confirm `git log --oneline --graph -n 10` shows merge topology (no rewritten linearized history from rebase).
- Proceed with normal `git push` only after these checks pass.

### GitHub Runtime Decision Policy

- **Default to Best Practice:** Implement the most recommended path autonomously when multiple options exist.
- **Document Trade-offs:** Capture unresolved decisions, explicit options, and impacts in the PR description.
- **Never Stall:** Proceed immediately with safe defaults. Request preference feedback in the PR instead of waiting.
- **Report Defensively:** Present recommended option first; list alternatives only if they alter scope or risk.

## Restricted Shell Rules

- In allowlisted shells, do not assume `grep`, `rg`, or complex pipelines are
  permitted just because `gh` is permitted.
- Prefer `gh --json/--jq/--template` over external text filters.
- Probe one command shape first before parallel fan-out.
- If a shell policy blocks a `gh`-adjacent command shape, classify it as
  `POLICY_DENIED` and pivot immediately.

## Failure Signatures

- Empty stdout from a supposedly successful `gh` query is a signal, not a
  success. Check whether the subcommand supports the requested mode in this
  environment.
- If a shell policy blocks a `gh`-adjacent command shape, classify it as
  `POLICY_DENIED` and pivot immediately.

## What to Avoid

- Do not use `-f` (`--raw-field`) when you intend to read a value from a file
  using `@`; always use `-F` (`--field`) for file expansion.
- Do not build `gh ... | grep ... | grep ...` chains as the default diagnostic
  path.
- Do not retry the same `gh` command shape after semantic warnings.
- Do not create temp files for comments or analysis when direct `gh`
  subcommands are available.

## Maintenance

Update this skill when new `gh` failure signatures, routing patterns, or
reliable structured-query workflows are discovered.
