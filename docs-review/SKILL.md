# Docs Review

Guidance for reviewing core architecture, documentation, and constraint files for mutual consistency and accuracy. Use this skill when checking repository documentation.

## When to Use

- Checking core architecture files (`*.mmd`, `*.mzn`) for consistency.
- Reviewing documentation (`**/AGENTS.md`, `**/README.md`) for outdated references.
- After any significant architectural decision to verify documentation exists and is accurate.
- When encountering complex code to ensure it's properly documented.
- When verifying an operational procedure or tradeoff.

## Core Process

1. **Analyze Relationships**:
   Cross-reference the relationships, definitions, rules, and configurations defined across these files.
2. **Identify Inconsistencies**:
   Look for contradictions, outdated references, missing updates, or structural mismatches between files.
3. **Verify Up-to-Date Status**:
   Check if any of the documentation lags behind the current state of the repository.
4. **Conditional Edits**:
   **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** ONLY apply changes to these files if actual inconsistencies, contradictions,
   or outdated information are found. If all files are mutually consistent and up-to-date,
   do not make any edits—simply report back that the files are in order.

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) Verification

**Verify:** Every significant decision has an ADR (typically stored in `docs/decisions/`).

## Code-Level Documentation Verification

**Verify:** Every non-obvious code block has a "why" comment.
**Verify:** Code-level comments don't state the obvious.

## Runbooks Verification

**Verify:** Every on-call alert has a linked runbook (typically stored in `docs/runbooks/`).

## README Currency Verification

**Verify:** README reflects current state (not v1 state).
**Verify:** Setup instructions work on a fresh machine.
**Verify:** Architecture diagrams are up to date.

## Subdirectory Agents (`AGENTS.md`) Verification

**Verify:** Subdirectories with specific functionality have local `AGENTS.md` context files.
**Verify:** Local `AGENTS.md` aligns with the global repository invariants.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] ADRs written for significant architectural decisions
- [ ] Non-obvious code blocks have "why" comments
- [ ] Every production alert has a linked runbook
- [ ] README is current and setup instructions work
- [ ] Subdirectories with specific functionality have local `AGENTS.md` context files
